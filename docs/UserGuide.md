GoMedic is a **cross-platform desktop application written in Java and designed for doctors and medical residents to
manage contacts and patient details**. We aim GoMedic to be used by someone who can type fast and take advantage of the
optimized features for Command Line Interface.

GoMedic is bootstrapped using SE-EDU Address Book 3 and inherits some of its features such as `clear`, parameter
formatting, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `gomedic.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your GoMedic.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app
   contains some sample data.<br> 
   ![Ui-activity](images/Ui-activity.png)
   
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`list t/patient`** : Lists all patients.

    * **`add t/patient n/John-Doe a/30 g/M h/174 w/72 b/O c/12345678 o/heart-failure o/diabetes`** : Adds a contact
      named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * **`delete t/patient P001`** : Deletes the patient whose id is P001.

    * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts including patients, doctors, and activities.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.
6. **Address Book, GoMedic Address Book, and GoMedic** refers to the same term, which is just the application itself. 
7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Words in `LOWER_CASE` are required flags to be written together with the command. <br>
  e.g. in `add t/activity`, `t/activity` is a flag that must be written as it is and should not be changed or treated as
  a parameter.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* There are fixed multiple valid date and time formats (GMT+8 24-Hour Time format):
    1. dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm (e.g. 15/09/2022 13:00)
    2. dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm (e.g. 15-09-2022 13:00)
    3. yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm (e.g. 2022-09-15-13-00)

* Patient ID is **unique** (i.e. every patient will be assigned to a unique ID, hence this guarantees
  1 `delete t/patient` command will not delete 2 patients at once).
* Invalid Patient ID being supplied would be flagged by GoMedic, and do not cause changes to any existing patients.
* Invalid `OPTIONAL_TO_DELETE` conditions supplied would be flagged by GoMedic, and do not cause changes to the existing

If more than 1 keyword is specified, results that contain at least 1 of the keywords will be returned (i.e. `OR` search)
E.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Users can specify additional optional parameters to limit the keyword matching to the fields that is associated with each
flag. Parameters will only match results that contain the associated field (E.g. n/Hans will not return any `activities`
since `activities` do not have a `name` field.)

Format: `find [OPTIONAL_PARAMETERS]...`

The parameters are:

* `n/NAME`: Matches the name field (Valid for: `Patients`, `Doctors`)
* `c/CONTACT_NUMBER`: Matches the contact number field (Valid for: `Patients`, `Doctors`)
* `a/AGE`: Matches the age field (Valid for: `Patients`)
* `g/GENDER`: Matches the gender field; The only valid keywords for this field are `M/F/O` (Valid for: `Patients`)
* `h/HEIGHT`: Matches the height field (Valid for: `Patients`)
* `w/WEIGHT`: Matches the weight field (Valid for: `Patients`)
* `b/BLOOD_TYPE`: Matches the blood type field; The only valid keywords for this field are `A/B/AB/O`
  (Valid for: `Patients`)
* `o/MEDICAL_CONDITION`: Limits the keyword search to the list of medical conditions of a patient (Valid
  for: `Patients`)
* `s/DEPARTMENT`: Matches the department field (Valid for: `Doctors`)
* `ti/TITLE`: Matches the title field (Valid for: `Activities`)
* `ta/TAG_DESCRIPTION`: Matches results that contain the specified tag in its list of tags (Valid for: `Activities`,
  _Tagging for `Doctors` and `Patients` coming soon_)

Note: 
* Keyword is case-insensitive for convenience (“dia” will match diabetic patients even if the user stored the patient's
  condition as “Diabetes”)
* Parameters can be repeated (e.g. `find n/Hans n/Bo` will return both `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`)
* If the optional parameters is not specified, the keyword will match any fields. E.g. `find dia` will return:
    1. Doctor Claudia, whose name matches `dia`
    2. Patient Jaryl, whose medical condition, `diabetes`, matches `dia`
    3. Doctor Tom, whose specialty, `Pediatrics`, matches `dia`
    4. Patient Lydia, whose name matches `dia`

* Clashing activity (including partial overlap with other activities) would be considered as invalid
  activity (i.e. not to be added).

Examples:

* `add t/activity s/2022-09-15-14-00 e/15/09/2022 15:00 ti/Meeting with Mr. X d/about a certain paper`
* `add t/activity s/15/09/2022 14:00 e/15/09/2022 15:00 ti/Meeting with Mr. Y`

### List all activities: `list t/activity`

List all existing (past, present and future) activities that exist in GoMedic.

Format: `list t/activity`

* Activities would be displayed in ascending `START_TIME` (The past activities would be at the top if any and Future
  activities at the bottom).
* The summary or description that are too long would be truncated.
* The `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` would be displayed in `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm` GMT+8 24-Hour format.

Examples:

* `list t/activity`

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

### Saving the data

GoMedic data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save
manually.

### Editing the data file

Currently, all the data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome
to update data directly by editing that data file.

In the subsequent releases, the patient data can be found at `[JAR file location]/data/patients.json`, doctors data
at `[JAR file location]/data/doctors.json`, and finally all activities at `[JAR file location]/data/activities.json`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, GoMedic will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous GoMedic home folder.
